# Get Started

## User Guide

You can start by creating your own Nextra site and deploying to Vercel by clicking the link:

[![](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?demo-description=Markdown%20powered%20docs%20site.%20Built%20with%20Next.js.&demo-image=https%3A%2F%2Fnextra.vercel.app%2Fdemo.png&demo-title=Documentation%20Starter%20Kit&demo-url=https%3A%2F%2Fnextra.vercel.app%2F&project-name=nextjs-docs&repository-name=nextjs-docs&s=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fshuding%2Fnextra&from=templates)

Vercel will create the Nextra repository and deploy the site for you with just a few clicks.  
Once done, every change in the repository will be deployed automatically.

## Chat rooms

Public rooms can be joined by anyone with the room URL. By default, rooms are given a random and un-guessable name. You can name your room whatever you'd like, but keep in mind that simpler room names are more guessable by others. For maximum security, consider using the default room name.

To connect to others, share the room URL with a secure tool such as Burner Note or Yopass. You will be notified when others join the room.

Chat message transcripts are erased as soon as you close the page or navigate away from the room.
