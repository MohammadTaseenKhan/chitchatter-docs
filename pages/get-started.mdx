# User Guide

## Chat rooms

Public rooms can be joined by anyone with the room URL. By default, rooms are given a random and un-guessable name. You can name your room whatever you'd like, but keep in mind that simpler room names are more guessable by others. For maximum security, consider using the default room name.

To connect to others, share the room URL with a secure tool such as Burner Note or Yopass. You will be notified when others join the room.

Chat message transcripts are erased as soon as you close the page or navigate away from the room.
